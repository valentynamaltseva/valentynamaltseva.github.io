I'm a scientist working at the intersection of experimental histology, biomaterials, and regenerative medicine.  
My research focuses on the preclinical assessment of both novel and clinically established biomaterials for bone implants, tested under healthy and osteoporotic conditions in accordance with ISO guidelines. Additionally, I explore intervertebral disc degeneration using rat models by analyzing experimentally induced pathogenic factors. 

Research Focus
======
* Biocompatibility testing of titanium-based implants  
* Intervertebral disc degeneration
* Bone densitometry and osteoporosis modeling  
* Histological techniques and tissue analysis  
* Fluorescence and histological image analysis
